  <p> <br> Soldering is pretty cool. Actually, it's kinda hot. Bad jokes aside, I learned that soldering is quite simple. 
    <br>
    All you need to do is use a soldering iron and some solder to connect pieces of metal or other electronic parts to a printed circuit board.
   <br> If you are able to follow directions, the circuit should connect and your electronic aplliance will work. 
    <br>  Simple stuff right? I can't hear you so I'm assuming you said yes. Here's some pictures.</p>

  <p> If you have a keen eye (or know what soldering is) you will notice that both of those pictures are not soldering, but instead just standard electronics. 
    <br>
    These are just like soldering but easier to do because there is no melting into place. </p>
