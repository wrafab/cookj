  <title> I made a skateboard, yayy. </title>
  <h><strong> Wonderful! Skateboards!</strong></h>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> .<br> First I thought about what I wanted on my skateboard.
    Then I rastered the image onto the board with the Epilog Engraver.
    A Partner was needed to help put the board together.
    I taped a bag together and pumped the air out to make sure the board dried properly.
    After the board dried I sanded it together so it didn't look like trash.
