<h1> Stupendous! </h1>


<p> This week we made stickers with corel draw. As usual with Corel Draw we imported the images we wanted into the program but this time we powerclipped images inside of a shape. <br> Then we matched the contour lines and used a vinyl cutter to cut them out.
 <br>
<p> I chose this spray from Overwatch as my sticker because I am a very spontaneous and as long as it fulfills the requirement, I'm happy. </p>

<p> To be totally honest with you, I think the spaghetti monster is pretty cool. </p>

  <p> Oh wow! I really liked Avatar when I was younger so I felt compelled to make this sticker. This sticker in particular used the Roland Vinyl Cutter as it was black. That means something, I'm sure. </p>

  <p> While on the topic of nerds, I made the Spirit Medallion from Ocarina of Time. This was made with corel draw. I imported the image and made little squares equidistant from the edges. Three different wood tiles were made, one empty tile with the mold and two tiles with the spirit medallion. </p>

 <p> Later in the week we did milling and composites. I decided to use a mold of a sunflower from Plants vs. Zombies for my chocolate mold. I exported the file and then used the Roland CNC mill to drill out the image.
