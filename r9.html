  <p> Raspberry pi is neat, I suppose. 
    <br>
    Learning about it was simple because we were given everything we needed to do. All we needed to do was think about why it works.
    <br>
    Scratch is an okay program, but I prefer Python much more.
    <br>
   Both are important though because they can accomplish different things.
    <br>
    My favorite project was creating pixel art with the HAT for the Raspberry pi. I made a house. </p>
