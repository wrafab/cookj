  <p> Ah yes, the final project. Something you need to put a lot of time and effort into.
  <br>
  I came up with the miraculous idea to create a frisbee with an amazing sticker on it. A Gerbsbee if I may.
  <br> 
  First, I got an stl file of a frisbee and milled it out.
  <br>
  Second, I photoshopped Mr.Gerber's face onto Kirby's body and then put put the images into Corel Draw.
  <br>
  Third, I printed out a sticker of Gerby and waited for the mold to finish in the mill.
  <br> 
  After the milling finished, I cut the mold out, put burlap over the mold, glued it together with resin, and vacuum bagged them for a night.
  <br> 
  I came back in the morning to take the frisbee out and cut around the leftover burlap. Then I put the Gerby sticker on and the Gerbsbee was created.
  <br> 
  I had a little too much fun with the Gerby picture and decided to create shirts for the whole class too.
  <br>
  Digital Engineering is a great class. 5/5 on Yelp.
  <br>
  In hindsight, I should have figured out what I wanted to do a long time ago instead of the day before the project was due, but I am still pleased with what I made.
  <br> 
  I did spend all day in the makerspace though so I did put in some time (about 4.5 class periods worth).
